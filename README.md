# FT8900_09Fit

This is a mount for installing both a Yaesu FT-8900R amateur radio and a standard single DIN stereo in a 2009-2013 Honda Fit.
This bracket snaps inside of an adapter which normally allows a double DIN stereo to be installed in place of the stock unit.
It also has holes for mounting an RJ12 6P6C jack for the microphone and a rocker switch which I use to run the radios without the key in the ignition.

To use this you will need:
1-Yaesu FT-8900 or FT-8800 (I would love to hear from people with the various Chinese clones of these radios, TYT TH-9800, etc... to find out if they fit too)
1-Single DINN car stereo
1-Metra 95-7877 double DINN stereo installation kit for the Honda Fit
1-RJ12 6p6c jack - I used this one https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYRH49T?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details
1-Power Relay
1-Rocker Switch - I need to come back and add the exact model.
1-Stereo Wiring Harness for the Honda Fit - I used this one https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0915SCHVF?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details
1-Antenna Adapter for the Honda Fit - I used this oen https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0875SJMSP?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details
Power and ham radio antenna wires ran into your dash, where the radio goes

It may be tempting to wire the ham radio to the existing power wires for the stereo. These may not be able to handle the current. Also, it is usually advisable to
run a heavy duty power wire directly to the battery for amateur radio use anyway. This minimizes electrical noise. A wire ran directly to the battery however
bipasses the ignition switch.  I like to add a relay behind my radio and run the power wire through the contacts of the relay. Then I wire the coil of the relay to
the switched power input that originally went to the car stereo.  I connect both my car stereo and my ham radio to this relay-switched power line. I also bypass the 
relay with a switch. (the rocker switch mentioned above) This way I can run the radios without the keys in the ignition, such as when using the crossband repeat
feature of the amateur radio.

I have this installed in my car now however I would like to come back and revisit this file to add some more features.

For one, I forgot to write down the model number of the switch before assembling everything. The hole is perfectly sized for the switch I used which came from my
junkbox.  I do remember that I found the same switch on Amazon however there were several others of slightly different sizes for much better prices. I may just
adjust the model for one of those. Ultimately I would like to make the model parametric and give the user a choice of switches or the ability to just enter the
switch dimensions allowing any switch to be used. Some people might like an option to omit the switch as well.

The screws that hold the microphone connector on kind of stick out. I may create a version with countersunk holes and get a pair of black countersunk screws to match.

I am thinking of adding a couple of screw holes below where the ham radio sticks out with mounts for heatset threaded inserts behind them. Then I would like to
design a cellphone holder that would hang down below the radios. Currently I use a clip-on holder that clips to the air vents above the radios. Having something that
is permanently mounted and does not block the vents would be much nicer. Not blowing hot air on my phone in the winter would probably be better for the phone too.

I also wanted to have mount a USB jack on the front with a charger on the inside. There was no room for this. I could make that an option that takes the place of the
switch for people who do not want the switch. If I go with the cellphone mount idea I will probably include a wireless charger and a hole through this model to run
the power wire for that.
